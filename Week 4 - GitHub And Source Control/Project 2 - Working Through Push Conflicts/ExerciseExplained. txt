In this excercise we created a file in the week 1 folder (using the GitHub Web interface) and then created powershell.ps1 in the week 2 folder using VSCode. We tried to commit and then push our powershell code to our repository but got an error stating that our branch was one commit ahead of what was in our respository. This was verified with the 'git status' command. We resolved this issue by using the command 'git pull' to download the  changes made in the web UI and then 'git push' to push our code to the repository.
